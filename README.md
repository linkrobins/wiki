# Link Robins Wiki

A wiki / knowledge-base extension for Flarum 2. Members write public articles
with full edit history; every change is captured as an immutable revision.

## Features

- **Public articles.** Anyone can read articles. Members with the
  permission can create them and edit collaboratively.
- **Categories.** Admin-configurable, each with name, slug, description,
  color, icon, and position. Articles can be filed under one category
  (or none).
- **Revision history.** Every save that changes an article's title or
  body records a revision — a snapshot of the title and content at that
  point, attributed to the editor. The history is read-only and viewable
  from the article page.
- **Markdown content.** Article bodies run through Flarum's formatter, so
  Markdown/BBCode and format extensions (mentions, emoji) work the same as
  in discussions. The rendered HTML is produced on demand at serialize
  time, so format extensions apply retroactively to older articles.
- **Moderation.** Editors can soft-delete and restore articles; soft-deleted
  articles stay visible to editors (with a "deleted" treatment) and hidden
  from everyone else. Permanent deletion is admin-only and requires the
  article to be soft-deleted first, then cascades to its revisions.
- **File attachments.** Optional integration with `fof/upload`.

## Requirements

- Flarum 2.0.0+
- PHP 8.3+

## Installation

```bash
composer require linkrobins/wiki
php flarum migrate
php flarum cache:clear
```

Then enable the extension in admin → Extensions.

## Permissions

- `linkrobins-wiki.createArticle` — start new articles.
- `linkrobins-wiki.editArticles` — edit and moderate (soft-delete /
  restore) any article, not just one's own.

Authors can always edit their own articles. Admins bypass every check.
Permanent deletion is admin-only.

## Forum UI

- `/wiki` — the article list, with a category filter in the sidebar.
- `/wiki/new` — write a new article (title, optional category, body).
- `/wiki/:id` — the article page, with the rendered body, edit/moderation
  controls, and the revision history.
- `/wiki/:id/edit` — edit an existing article.

## Admin UI

Settings live at admin → Extensions → Link Robins Wiki: full CRUD for
article categories.

## Data model

Three tables:

- `linkrobins_wiki_categories` — name, slug, description, color, icon,
  position.
- `linkrobins_wiki_articles` — category_id, user_id (author),
  last_edited_by_user_id, title, content (parsed-source), last_edited_at,
  deleted_at.
- `linkrobins_wiki_revisions` — article_id, user_id (editor), title,
  content, summary.
